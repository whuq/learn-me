## â€¢ Let me tell you about myself

-  I am from Turkey "Erzincan" :blush:

- I have been dealing with graphic designs since childhood. I have opened my github account to showcase my ever-increasing projects here. ðŸ’˜

- I will display all my protection systems and all my design projects that I wrote on Github, whether or not they eat GPUs and CPUs. ðŸ’Ÿ

> **Now that you know some information about me, congratulations you have earned a couple of X10 Experience points from me.** ðŸ’«
